excerpt: Crypto Voices is about education. A bit of entertainment too. The focus is on Bitcoin, blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital ledger technology and broader FinTech, including all of the benefits and challenges that come with these breakthrough technologies. We understand the words Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, digital money and blockchain have come to mean different things to different people. We admit to using these terms interchangeably on this site, and believe that, however Bitcoin and other blockchains competitively emerge, these ideas will soon be as ubiquitous across the globe as the Internet is today, just as that was quite hard to understand not so long ago. If they aren't, then that means the world will have found something better than blockchain technology, which is a good thing.
