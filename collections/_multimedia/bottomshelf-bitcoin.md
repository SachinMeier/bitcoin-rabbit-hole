excerpt: With Bottomshelf Bitcoin you don’t have to be a cryptographer or computer scientist to understand Bitcoin. I’m breaking down complex subjects into easily understood pieces, and putting those pieces on the bottom shelf, where anyone can reach them. From history to cutting edge technology, politics to art, and everything in between, join me each week as I talk to various guests about how their lives and work intersect with Bitcoin.
