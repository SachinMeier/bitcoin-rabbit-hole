excerpt: The recent Bitcoin protocol bug, CVE-2018-1744, received considerable amounts of alarmist press, “For less than $80,000, you could have brought down the entire network,” “The most catastrophic bug in recent years, and certainly one of the most catastrophic bugs in Bitcoin ever.” Despite these claims, few looked into the detail of the bug and the game theory behind executing an attack. Code has bugs; code has always had bugs, rather than focus on criticising developers it is important to assess how it happened, why it happened and how to avoid similar problems in the future.
