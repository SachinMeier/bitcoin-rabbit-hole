excerpt: There's an article doing the rounds at the moment titled 'Fundamental challenges with public blockchains' that gives a really good look into the state of crypto at the moment - check it out if you haven't seen it already. I found this article super interesting as it summarises really well the state of confusion that exists around crypto at the moment in Silicon Valley.
