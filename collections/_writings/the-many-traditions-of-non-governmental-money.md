title: The Many Traditions Of Non-Governmental Money
date: 2018-03-23
categories: ['Money']
author: ['Nick Szabo']
excerpt: The central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve, has put out “educational material” on Bitcoin for teachers and students (including a quiz!). The Bitcoin parts are odd enough, but this and a subsequent blog post will focus on the following statement “traditionally, currency is produced by a nation's government.“ Is that a fair representation of monetary traditions.
