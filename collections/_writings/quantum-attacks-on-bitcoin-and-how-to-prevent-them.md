excerpt: We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in  the  next  10  years,  mainly  because  specialized  ASIC  miners  are  extremely  fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers.  On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates.
