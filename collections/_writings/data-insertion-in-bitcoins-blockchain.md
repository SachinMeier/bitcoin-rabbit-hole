excerpt: It is common knowledge that extrinsic data can be stored in the Blockchain,  and there are numerous websites that provide access to a subset of that data, and some excellent sleuthing has uncovered a variety of interesting historical artifacts that have previously been stored. Nevertheless, there remains confusion and misinformation about the variety of different methods by which data can be (and has been) stored.
