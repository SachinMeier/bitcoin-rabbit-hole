title: Postscript On The Societies Of Control
date: 1997-10-01
categories: ['Society']
author: ['Gilles Deleuze']
excerpt: In this short essay Deleuze looks to move beyond Michel Foucault’s historical understanding of ‘disciplinary societies’, where power is exercised within discrete institutions, towards the concept of 'societies of control'. In many ways it parallels the ideas of the Italian radical left around the concept of the ‘social factory’, providing an intersection between post-structuralist philosophy and autonomist Marxism.
