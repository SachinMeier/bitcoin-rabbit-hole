author: ['Jesús Huerta de Soto']
excerpt: Jesús Huerta de Soto, professor of economics at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, has made history with this mammoth and exciting treatise. He integrates sweeping history and rigorous theory to make the good-as-gold case that the institutions of money and banking can be part of the free market — without a central bank, without bailouts, without inflation, without business cycles, and without the economic instability that has characterized the age of government control.
