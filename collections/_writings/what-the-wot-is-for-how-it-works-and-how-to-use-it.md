excerpt: The Web of Trust is "of trust" in the same exact manner the walk of shame is "of shame" - it's not in the clothes you wear, nor in your tussled up hair, nor in the eyes of random jocks passing by that notice these, nor in the memories of your friends that recall perfectly fine what you wore yesterday that shame lies. It's within you, if at all, if you're the amateur sort of slut who'd be shamed by something like this. All up to you.
