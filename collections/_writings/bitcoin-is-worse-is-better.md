excerpt: The irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions makes for some unusual dynamics in exchanges, along with the entire altcoin ecosystem (probably the most interesting altcoin scam to me was the Bytecoin scam+anonymity innovation). I learned of an interesting example in May 2013, when a Reddit post introduced me to a Tor hidden site which offers you double your money back if you send it some bitcoins.
