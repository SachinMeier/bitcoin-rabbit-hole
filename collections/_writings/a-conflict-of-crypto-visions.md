title: A Conflict of Crypto Visions
date: 2019-01-29
categories: ['Bitcoin']
author: ['Arjun Balaji', 'Yassine Elmandjra']
excerpt: Conflicts raging within crypto are endless. Heated debates take place on a wide spectrum of issues, with little attempt to devise compromises acceptable to both sides. Interestingly, it is the same people who consistently position themselves on opposite sides of these issues. From monetary maximalism and wealth distribution to governance and consensus algorithms, the issues vary tremendously while the formed groups of opposition remain the same. Naturally, this creates an unproductive habit of each side blindly talking past the other.
