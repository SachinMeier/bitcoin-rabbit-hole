excerpt: It recently came to my atention that known conmen are openly advertising "Bitcoin certification". While so-called certification is a preminent and widely reviled part of the bezzle that the USG mostly consists of, and while their execution is exactly as appallingly poor as you'd expect from someone affectionately dubbed "the shit fountain", I suspect there may be some merit nevertheless in the idea of allowing interested parties to score their knowledge of a field.
