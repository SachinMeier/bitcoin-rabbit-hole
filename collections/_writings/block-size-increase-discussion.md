excerpt: Block size is a question to which there is no answer, but which certainly has a LOT of technical tradeoffs to consider. I know a lot of people here have varying levels of strong or very strong opinions about this, and the fact that it is not being discussed in a technical community publicly anywhere is rather disappointing.
