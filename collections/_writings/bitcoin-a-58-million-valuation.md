author: ['Mr. Game and Watch']
excerpt: This paper tries to demystify Bitcoin's value proposition. First, we note that the word "Bitcoin" refers to both a digital collectible, as well as to a peer-to-peer computer network. The collectible is required to make use of the payment network -- even for transactions denominated in USD (not BTC).
