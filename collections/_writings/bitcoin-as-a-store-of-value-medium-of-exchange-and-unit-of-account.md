title: Bitcoin As A Store Of Value, Medium Of Exchange And Unit Of Account
date: 2015-01-12

author: ['Daniel Krawisz']
excerpt: Some recent mumblings on CoinDesk on the idea of a cryptocurrency whose value is stabilized with a built-in prescription that manages its supply provoked me to write this article on why this is a vain dream. There is a common fallacy which says that price stability is required in order for a currency to function as a form of money.
