title: On Stake And Consensus
date: 2015-03-22
categories: ['Mining and Consensus']
author: ['Andrew Poelstra']
excerpt: We explored an alternative to DMMS, proof of stake. We showed that by depending only on resources within the system, proof of stake cannot be used to form a distributed consensus, since it depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value.
