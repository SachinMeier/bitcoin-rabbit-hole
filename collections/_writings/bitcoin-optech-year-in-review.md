title: Bitcoin Optech 2018 Year in Review Special
date: 2018-12-28
categories: ['Technical']
author: ['Bitcoin Optech']
excerpt: This weekâ€™s newsletter is a special year-end edition summarizing notable developments in Bitcoin during all of 2018. Despite the extended length of this newsletter, we regret that it only covers a tiny fraction of the work put into dozens of open source projects by hundreds of contributors. Without those low-level contributions, the high-concept ideas described in this newsletter would be just empty words, and so we extend our most sincere thanks to all of you who contributed to Bitcoin development this year.
