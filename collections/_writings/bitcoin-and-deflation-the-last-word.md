title: Bitcoin And Deflation&#58 The Last Word
date: 2015-05-15
categories: ['Bitcoin']
author: ['Paul Storzc']
excerpt: When I first got into Bitcoin (in 2011), I understood why it had to introduce coins gradually (the mining half of this previous post) and also why it had to ultimately stop introducing coins, hence the fixed steady-state money supply (the 21 million coin limit). Somehow, years later, the debate rages on, still by people who seem to think that the limited supply has something to do with macroeconomic policy.
