title: Shelling Out&#58 Origins Of Money
date: 2002-01-01
categories: ['Money and Austrian Econ']
author: ['Nick Szabo']
excerpt: The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot – including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics – they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.
