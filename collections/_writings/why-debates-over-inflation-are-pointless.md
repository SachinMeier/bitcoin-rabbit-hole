title: Why Debates Over Inflation Are Pointless

categories: ['The Economics of Sound Money']
author: ['Scott Sumner']
excerpt: In a recent post I suggested that one could argue that the entire increase in per capita income over the past 50 years was pure inflation (and hence that real GDP per capita didnâ€™t rise at all.) But also that one could equally well argue that there has been no inflation over the past 50 years. The official government figures show real GDP/person rising slightly more than 150% since 1964, whereas the PCE deflator is up about 6-fold.
