excerpt: ‘Tis the season again when the Bitcoin exchange rate rises fast and “bubble” talk resumes among some journalistic and other Bitcoin skeptics. Around the height of the previous most dramatic Bitcoin exchange rate movements of March and April 2013, I posted an article called “Hyper-monetization Questioning the ‘Bitcoin bubble’ bubble,” which was widely circulated at the time and still referenced now.
