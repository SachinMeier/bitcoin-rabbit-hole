### Bitcoin As Money

Bitcoin presents us with an opportunity to reinvent gold, or even rethink money
for the digital future. A number of economists have suggested that it may be
more appropriate to evaluate items based on their degree of moneyness.
According to this thinking, it isn’t that something either is or is not money;
on the contrary, many items can play a monetary role and some items can play
this role more effectively than others. In a number of ways, bitcoins have a
high degree of moneyness. They are more portable, durable, divisible, and scarce
than both gold and government fiat currency.

As of today, bitcoins can best be described as digital commodities with monetary
properties. According to the Bitcoin Maximalist
[interpretation](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/954225789129469952) of
monetary history, it is likely that a new, scarce form of money would evolve
roughly along the following lines:

1. Collectible
2. Store of Value
3. Medium of Exchange
4. Unit of Account.

Proponents of bitcoins as digital cash believe that utility should initially
take precedence over store of value, and prioritize attaining the medium of
exchange role before store of value by making payments as cheap as possible.

Those who believe bitcoin will become the future global monetary standard
ascribe current volatility to the fact that bitcoin is undergoing the process of
monetization, and that a global cognitive shift is slowly occurring. In their
view, despite great volatility, the long-term parabolic ascent of the price is a
testament to more and more people believing in a future world where Bitcoin is
widely used.

Crypto-[Austrians](https://mises.org/what-austrian-economics) who consider
themselves [Rothbardians](https://www.mises.org/profile/murray-n-rothbard), such
as author [Saifedean Ammous](https://twitter.com/saifedean), believe that
bitcoin’s disinflationary nature and cap on supply makes it the most sound money
ever invented. They believe that bitcoin, with its fixed monetary supply, is the
only fair form of money, as well as one which allows for the most efficient
capital allocation by individuals and most efficient price signalling by the
market as a whole.

Many individuals in this group are against the idea of fractional-reserve
banking and consider it to be fraudulent. They believe that a fractional-reserve
banking system is unlikely to emerge atop bitcoin, as bitcoins lack the physical
centralization of gold, which forced settlements and clearance to necessarily
pass through centralized choke-points, allowing governments to have complete
control over the money supply, transmission, and the monetary regime at large.
The governments had so much control that they were able to get rid of the
gold-standard (which was organically chosen by the market over centuries) and
introduce their own fiat standards, not backed by any commodity.

These individuals believe that fractional-reserve systems are simply
unsustainable in the long run without lenders of last resort, which do not
inherently exist in Bitcoin, and that people would be unwilling to accept
bitcoin-substitutes in the market.

Those in the “[Free
Banking](https://www.alt-m.org/2015/07/18/hayek-and-free-banking/)” wing of the
Austrian school, such as [George
Selgin](https://www.hillsdale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FMF-2014-Bitcoin-Problems-and-Prospects.pdf)
and [Lawrence
White](https://soundcloud.com/cryptovoices/show-40-lawrence-white-money-banking-bitcoin),
believe that bitcoin’s strictly fixed-supply and lack of lenders of last resort
do not technically prevent a competitive system of fractional-reserve banks and
entities arising atop bitcoin, or in an economy where bitcoin is the defacto
monetary standard.

It is clear that there is a chance that bitcoin can, at the very least, emerge
as a mildly volatile digital commodity, a store of value akin to digital gold.
However, doubts remain whether it will transcend the raw store of value role and
achieve low enough volatility to become a global medium of exchange and a unit
of account.

Some believe that, due to its strictly inelastic supply, bitcoin is unlikely to
be stable in its purchasing power anytime soon, if ever, and that people prefer
for their day-to-day currency to be stable in purchasing power. These people
have expressed excitement about the emergence of cryptocurrencies with more
flexible and self-regulating monetary policies built in. For example,
[stablecoins](http://juliankohtx.com/stablecoins-and-the-story-of-money/) aim to
peg their market value against another form of value, such as the USD or a
basket of goods, using an algorithmic central bank.

Others
[believe](https://medium.com/@rextar4444/a-neo-gold-standard-bitcoins-optimal-use-case-62d7fbb2f76f)
that, despite bitcoin’s strictly inelastic supply, bitcoin is a perfect solution
to [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.)’s [Ideal
Money](http://personal.psu.edu/gjb6/nash/money.pdf) proposal that he worked on
for over fifty years. Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics,
[proposed](http://web.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts_and_graphics/Main.Content/IDEAL_MONEY.../Campus_for_Finance_of_2010/)
that central banks could inflation-target their currencies against an apolitical
index to achieve international relational stability of all state currencies. In
response to increasing demand for bitcoin, some believe banks will value target
their currencies against bitcoin as a basis for the standardization of the value
of money.

#### Deflationary Death Spiral

Mainstream, Keynesian, and Monetarist economists have expressed concerns with
Bitcoin’s fixed-supply. They fear the possibility of harsh deflationary
pressures if bitcoin becomes the predominant currency through the process known
as
[hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/).

Their fear is that the inability to expand the money supply would result in
bitcoin’s purchasing power growing by 2–3% per annum, roughly in line with the
growth rates of global economic output. Some have expressed concerns that
deflationary economics might reduce aggregate demand in the present and the
near-term, result in excessive savings and hoarding of money, and produce less
consumption, investment and entrepreneurial risk-taking by individuals.

Austrian economists believe that the fears associated with a deflationary form
of money are [overblown](https://mises.org/library/deflationary-spiral-bogey)
and that the ‘deflationary spiral’ is a myth. Austrian’s counter the Keynesian
and Monetarists concerns that the delay in spending doesn’t last in perpetuity
by reminding them that this spending is merely delayed into the future. People
will now have a lower time-preference and thatinstead of buying “useless” things
with their “hot potato” decaying money, they will turn their attention to
long-term productivity.

They also believe that business profit margins will not be hurt because not only
would product prices, but also business costs, deflate at the same rate, leaving
the profit margins unchanged. Austrians believe that deflation is absolutely
normal, and absent central control on the money supply, both capitalism and
technology are naturally deflationary phenomenons.This can be seen in the
less-regulated electronics industry, where increased storage/memory/compute
capacities are becoming cheaper every year.

According to Austrians, it is the *central bank inflationary fiat printing* that
exacerbates recessions and business cycles, as the perpetually-decaying money
embeds the citizenry constant anxiety and stress, resulting in not well
though-out investments and expenditures, collectively referred to as
‘malinvestment’. These malinvestments are typically inefficient allocations of
capital, which are unlikely to result in personal gains, societal gains,
productivity, or capital stock.

### Roles of Full Nodes & Miners in Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash

**The Scaling Debate**

The debate over how to scale Bitcoin is very polarizing, and is about scaling
throughput, also known as transactions per second (TPS). The main contention is
how much it should cost to run a [full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node),
and what the role of full nodes and miners should be in the the system.

In July 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin,
[supposedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3giend/citation_needed_satoshis_reason_for_blocksize/ctygzmi/)
added a 1 MB maximum block size limit as an anti-DoS (Denial of Service)
prevention mechanism. This 1 MB block size limit stood in place, and until
transaction volume increased heavily in 2017, the blocks were never close to
full capacity. When this limit was introduced, 1 MB was hundreds of times the
size of an average block.

In August 2017, an update called Segregated Witness (SegWit for short, see
dedicated section below) was activated, which increased the amount of data that
could be stored in a block to above 1 MB. Taking many by surprise, at around the
same time, on August 1, a fork of Bitcoin (BTC) named Bitcoin Cash (BCH) spawned
from users dissatisfied with the BTC developers’ scaling roadmap and emphasis on
bitcoins as digital gold. The developers of this fork quickly implemented 32 MB
blocks and are planning to increase the limit much further, which would allow
for more on-chain transactions per block and cheaper fees but make it more
expensive to run a full node.

Factors that influence the cost of running a full node include required
bandwidth, the size of the UTXO set (see
[this](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/ch05.html)
primer on Bitcoin transactions if you’re not familiar with the UTXO concept),
and required CPU, RAM, and disk space, which are all impacted by the block size.

Those who favor small blocks view them as essential to maintain decentralization
of the system by allowing any user to afford validation using a full node, and to
develop a [fee
market](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/the-fee-market-explained-76b294947b42) in
order to guarantee miner compensation as the block reward decreases.

The proponents of Bitcoin Cash, “big blockers,” view a block size limit as an
artificial limit maintained through a centralized planning mechanism in the form
of consensus rules. Many prefer miners selecting the size of blocks they are
willing to create based on market conditions. There are other blockchain
projects where this is the case, such as Ethereum where miners can
[vote](https://www.etherchain.org/tools/gasLimitVoting) to adjust the gas limit,
which is analogous to the block size in Bitcoin, a certain factor each block.

**The perspective of “small blockers” (Bitcoin project)**

> Full nodes relay transactions and blocks and do full verification of the data
> they relay to other members of the (full node) network, enforcing consensus
rules and serving as watchful eyes against potentially malicious miners.
>
> Bitcoin’s value arose from the system eliminating trust in third-parties, having
> resilience to state-level attacks, and its censorship-resistant nature. All
users having the ability to run a full node is essential to maintain these
characteristics.
>
> As the cost of running a full node increases, a smaller percentage of users can
> afford validation and enforce consensus rules, and a greater percentage of users
are forced into using Bitcoin in a trusted manner, relying on others to be
honest, rather than the robustness of the system as a whole.
>
> Massive blocks will eventually result in full nodes residing only in data
> centers, which increases centralization by putting consensus in the hands of a
limited number of entities, puts Bitcoin at a greater risk of getting shut down,
and degrades privacy by requiring users to connect to other nodes.
>
> SPV (Simple Payment Verification) clients, which are lightweight clients that
> can prove a transaction is included in a block without downloading the entire
blockchain, are incapable of trustless and complete validation.

At this time, even low-end computing devices such as a [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.renewable-energy-now.org/2017/07/raspberry-pi-bitcoin-full-node-english/)
can serve as a functioning full node. Many desire a future where even
smartphones can serve as full nodes.

In order for a full node to perform validation, it must propagate the entire
UTXO set that it derived by processing the entire chain. The UTXO set can shrink
by users and companies consolidating outputs, but it has been
[shown](http://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set) to
steadily increase over time and can grow infinitely in size.

By primarily using the blockchain as a settlement layer for off-chain
transactions and optimizing space efficiency through technological improvements,
the UTXO set is managed much more efficiently, block propagation latency and
initial blockchain syncing times are reduced, and the amount of bandwidth, CPU
power, RAM, and disk space required to run a full node are minimized.

Off-chain payment-channels (like the [Lightning
Network](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-summary.pdf)) are being
developed, which will be able to settle thousands or millions of transactions in
a single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Although miners are the only entities that can produce new candidate blocks,
economic full node operators signal and provide the incentive for miners to
create valid blocks by rejecting invalid ones. If a miner were to produce an
invalid block, such as one with differing consensus rules than those defined by
the rest of the network (e.g. tampering with issuance rate of new bitcoins or
altering the maximum number of bitcoins), full nodes would automatically ignore
it even if a majority of the hash power accepted the block as valid.

The ability for full nodes to reject invalid blocks and trustlessly verify
transactions leads to the saying “Don’t Trust, Verify” — and this is why full
nodes are deemed the network that miners are being paid to serve.

This is not to say that miners don’t have any control at all. Both full node
operators and miners power aspects of the system, despite having differing
roles. Miners can choose what transactions they include in blocks
(profit-maximizing miners will likely include ones with higher fees) and create
new blocks, whereas merchants and other full node operators (including mining
pool node operators) determine validity of blocks and transactions, enforcing
consensus rules.

A User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) [event](http://www.uasf.co/) in 2017
demonstrated that users operating full nodes were able to push miners to
activate SegWit despite only a minority of miners initially signaling that they
were in favor of the update.

**The perspective of “big blockers” (Bitcoin Cash project)**

Bitcoin Cash proponents look to scale toward unlimited block size and do not
believe in the importance of full nodes being cheap to run for all. They claim
the best version of Bitcoin was outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original
whitepaper, blog posts, and emails. They believe Satoshi only considered miners
to be the network and that consensus should be handled purely through hash
power.

Some big blockers believe that users simply transacting never need to run full
nodes, but others recommend
[incrementally](https://web.archive.org/web/20150213020502/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/)
increasing the block size in accordance to [Nielsen’s
Law](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) of bandwidth to allow
users with “reasonable” computers and internet connections to continue to run
full nodes.

> Miners are held accountable through profit-maximization and game theoretic
> market incentives. Miners will never collude as they are in direct competition
with one another to find new blocks and get bitcoins as a reward.

> The security model of SPV is good enough for end-users, and full nodes are
> powerless, passive observers to the mining network. Full nodes are only needed
by firms such as payment processors to provide services such as 0-confirmation
transactions and serving merkle-branch proofs to SPV clients.

> There is nothing sacred about non-monetary Bitcoin consensus rules, which should
> be allowed to [emerge](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/emergent-consensus)
through a market process.

From [Mark Wilcox](http://markwilcox.com/articles/03/):

> “The whole point of the Proof of Work game is that nodes cannot be trusted. The
> only thing we can trust is the difficulty of solving the problem, and the
economic interests of everyone involved. This means that, quite crucially,
‘everyone is responsible’ is different from ‘everyone must do everything’. We
collectively need to protect the network. But the whole point of rewarding nodes
that contribute hashpower is to free everyone else of the burden of having to
worry about attacks on monetary policy or denial of service.”

BCH proponents equate decentralization to competition and the network topology
of miners instead of full node cost. They rejected SegWit, and Bitcoin Cash was
their response. They encourage on-chain applications, such as the social network
[Memo](https://memo.cash/), which small blockers would likely view as spam and
encourage to be developed on upper-layer systems instead.

### Addressing “Satoshi’s Original Vision”

**The perspective of “small blockers” (Bitcoin project)**

BTC proponents believe that appealing to Satoshi’s words is a logical fallacy of
appealing to authority, and that Satoshi should no longer matter.

> “If you see the Buddha or a Buddha, kill him.”

They generally refer to BCH proponents as whitepaper “religious fundamentalists”
who are unable to accept that Bitcoin has organically evolved since its
inception. They view BTC as a far superior and more decentralized system than
BCH due to the ability for full nodes to serve as a p2p network governance
mechanism ([not a
democracy](https://medium.com/@beautyon_/democracy-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-way-bitcoin-works-it-is-a-political-system-where-a-group-of-efb37a627415)).

Many view BCH as a
[fraudulent](https://hackernoon.com/thats-not-bitcoin-that-s-bcash-f730f0d0a837)
project guided by leaders attempting to take over the Bitcoin brand and
establish a centralized, miner-controlled system that requires trust in
third-parties.

BTC proponents also
[mention](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002417.html)
that Satoshi laid the groundwork for the Lightning Network through a
high-frequency trading payment channel design. They also feel Satoshi’s original
design proved to be impossible without SPV fraud proofs, described in the SPV
section below.

Satoshi’s last words about block size were written in December 2010 during a
[discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917)
about BitDNS, a proposal to use Bitcoin for domain name issuance which led to
the creation of a merged-mined blockchain called
[Namecoin](https://www.namecoin.org/).

> “BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features
> since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get
increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it’s easy for
lots of users and small devices.”

Here, Satoshi alluded to the scaling debate and suggested limiting the size of
the blockchain might gain consensus.

Bitcoin Cash did not receive social consensus to be called Bitcoin based on the
User Activated Soft Fork, market cap, and hash rate. Instead, Bitcoin Cash hard
forked to create a new network, whereas Segregated Witness was an update to the
original Bitcoin network in which old software still functions.

**The perspective of “big blockers” (Bitcoin Cash project)**

BCH proponents pronounce that “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” as they believe Bitcoin
was designed to scale on-chain without ‘non-mining full nodes’ limiting the
throughput of the system. Instead, they believe miner’s nodes are the real full
nodes and note that Satoshi referred to miners as ‘nodes’ in his writings.

From Satoshi Nakamoto:

> “Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At
> first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a
certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms
of specialized hardware.”

> “The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended
> configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their
own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more
burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will
be big server farms.”

BCH proponents feel small blockers
[co-opted](https://derekmagill.com/2018/05/30/crash-course-bitcoin-core/) the
Bitcoin project to create a settlement network with high on-chain fees when
blocks are full. Some believe Core developers succeeded at changing people’s
understanding of Proof-of-Work (PoW) game theory, as they
[interpret](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zawlw/satoshi_whitepapers_longest_chain_is_bitcoin_rule/dewpjza/)
Satoshi’s descriptions of PoW as mining being the intended consensus mechanism.

*****

BTC proponents strongly
[object](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5j6758/myth_nakamoto_consensus_decides_the_rules_for/dbe7kbb/)
to the contention that miners ever controlled consensus rules. They note that
even in the [original](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin) node
software, the longest PoW chain rule only applied to resolving disputes between
multiple chains using the same consensus rules, and nodes had the option to
generate coins or not.

### Role of SPV

In contrast to full nodes, the type of software for lightweight Bitcoin clients
is SPV (Simple Payment Verification). SPV clients allow a user to connect to one
or more nodes (i.e. from a smartphone), determine the latest block with longest
PoW chain, and request [block
headers](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-headers) (80 bytes
each) from the node(s).

As described in section 8 of the whitepaper, a user can obtain the merkle branch
which confirms their transaction is inside a block with a valid block header and
proof of work. Further confirmations (new blocks on top of the other block)
demonstrate further work was done.

SPV clients cannot validate blocks or consensus rules themselves, so they must
trust the validation of the node(s) they are connected to.

A technique to increase SPV security, among others, was proposed by Satoshi in
the whitepaper to allow nodes to alert SPV clients when invalid blocks are
detected. Theoretical [fraud
proofs](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/fraud-proofs/) could prove the existence
of invalid blocks with minimal resources required, but a viable implementation
has not been discovered that proves to be DoS resistant.

Although fraud proofs are not implemented today, SegWit enables them to be
integrated into Bitcoin with a [soft-fork](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork),
which is a change that is backwards compatible with old clients and tightens or
adds new rules.

### Segregated Witness

A 2017 soft-fork to BTC called Segregated Witness, or SegWit for short, was
activated as the result of a multiple year scaling debate. It was primarily a
bug fix to an issue involving the malleability of transactions, but also adds
more space for transactions and enables easier future updates and extensions
through soft forks.

#### What is malleability?

Before SegWit, there were malleable (changeable) parts of transactions. For
example, a node relaying a transaction or a miner including it in a block could
add extra bytes to the transaction’s
[signature](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#term-signature). This changes
the ID, which is a cryptographic hash of the entire transaction, including the
signature.

Although there is malleability in other computer software, in the case of
Bitcoin, changing the transaction ID after the transaction propagated to the
network prevented wallet software to track transactions by ID, users from
performing certain types of transactions, and developers from creating certain
types of smart contracts.

For example, a valid transaction can spend an unconfirmed output (not yet
included in a block) as an input to another transaction in the same block. If
the transaction ID of the unconfirmed output was malleated, the first
transaction would be confirmed as it’s still valid, but the second transaction
would be invalid because the transaction data would include an invalid
Previous tx attribute.

Miners, full nodes, and users can choose to use SegWit or not, since it was a
soft fork. As of May 2018, transactions with SegWit inputs make up approximately
[35%](https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments/segwit) of transactions, and
SegWit nodes are at approximately
[95%](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/segwit.html)
distribution.

The rest of this section is fairly technical, so feel free to skim or skip to
the “Bitcoin Maximalism” section if you are a beginner.

Witness data refers to signatures and unlocking scripts. With SegWit, miners
“segregate the witness” by placing the witness data in a separate merkle tree
(the data structure inside a block that holds transactions) called the witness
merkle tree, which mirrors the transaction tree. The witness root hash is stored
in the coinbase transaction, which is the transaction that miners use to pay
themselves newly minted bitcoins. Therefore, signatures for SegWit transactions
are still included in blocks, since the coinbase transaction affects the merkle
root hash that is stored in the block header of a block.

If miners choose to not update to SegWit, then they can’t mine blocks with
SegWit inputs, as to them these are non-standard transactions. They can still
receive SegWit transactions with the witness structure stripped.

**The SegWit update (for more detail see [SegWit
benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)):**

* Phases out block size in favor of block weight. Currently, blocks can have at
most 4 million weight units (WU). A byte in the original block structure weighs
4 WU, whereas a byte in the witness structure only weighs 1 WU. For more, see
“[Understanding Segwit Block
Size](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/understanding-segwit-block-size-fd901b87c9d4).”
* Reduces the UTXO size for SegWit transactions by the size of witnesses, which is
around 60–75% of the data. The discount on weight units for the witness
structure was introduced to incentivize more responsible growth of the UTXO set
by lowering fees.
* Increases the amount of data that can be stored in blocks as the percentage of
SegWit transactions increases. The largest block we have
[seen](https://www.smartbit.com.au/block/0000000000000000001bbb529c64ddf55edec8f4ebc0a0ccf1d3bb21c278bfa7)
is 2.1MB.
* Allows payment channels, such as the Lightning Network, to take advantage of the
malleability fix.
* Fixes quadratic scaling of Sighash operations.
* Enables the checksummed [Bech32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiN9VFE4CU)
address format.
* Introduces Script versioning to allow for easier soft-forks in the future for
features such as SPV Fraud Proofs, [Schnorr signatures and Signature
aggregation](https://bitcointechtalk.com/scaling-bitcoin-schnorr-signatures-abe3b5c275d1)
and
[MAST](https://bitcointechtalk.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-merklized-abstract-syntax-tree-mast-33fdf2da5e2f)
which compress data and further aid on-chain scaling, and [Confidential
Transactions](https://www.elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/investigation.html).
* Makes covert
[ASICBoost](https://blog.bitmex.com/an-overview-of-the-covert-asicboost-allegation-2/)
ineffective (though [some](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/asicboost-worthless/)
dispute the relevance of ASICBoost in the first place).

**The following are arguments against SegWit:**

* [Some](http://thebitcoin.foundation/) users prefer that Bitcoin developers
change Satoshi’s codebase as little as possible.
* SegWit and the Lightning Network do not solve the scaling debate because users
will always have disagreements over how much it should cost to run a full node.
* SegWit technically used a mandatory extension block making it an “[Evil
Fork](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/forks-and-splits/)” or “[Forced
Fork](https://petertodd.org/2016/forced-soft-forks#radical-changes).”
* It is technically possible for miners to censor SegWit transactions in an
[anti-UASF](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/uasf-contradiction/) movement by not
including any transactions involving SegWit inputs.
* Jihan Wu, the CEO of Bitmain which is the largest mining ASIC manufacturer,
[called](https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/868896110760181760) SegWit
transactions “unfairly cheap” due to the discount on witness data.

### Bitcoin Maximalism

There are different flavors of Bitcoin Maximalists, but they all believe that
Bitcoin is the best and most secure blockchain which has the strongest network
effect, most desirable monetary policy, and a highly-capable scripting language
built which allows for future development.

Bitcoiners generally believe the idea of a ‘token economy’ reveals a deep
misunderstanding of monetary systems as a whole and view [tokens as snake
oil](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/appcoins-are-snake-oil/). They
strongly reject a future world of 10,000 currencies, seeing it as no different
to barter — the very problem that money is supposed to eliminate. They believe
that value accrues to the money held, not necessarily the one transacted with,
and the long tail of ‘tokens’ will suffer from extremely high velocity,
rendering them with little to no value accrual and serving as unnecessary
friction even if abstracted away from the end user.

### Upper-Layer Systems and Alt-Coins

Many Bitcoiners view
[alt-coins](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-problem-with-altcoins/) as
testing grounds for features that may eventually be integrated into Bitcoin if
desirable by users.

It is theoretically possible to copy [almost
any](http://www.drivechain.info/faq/index.html) blockchain, even a giant block
[one](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/gigachain/), and put it on a Bitcoin
sidechain. Paul Sztorc’s [Drivechain](http://www.drivechain.info/) project,
which is currently under development, would allow these blockchains to inherit
Bitcoin’s mining security, although it requires a soft-fork and is awaiting more
extensive peer review.

There are three main categories of changes that would (likely) never be
integrated into Bitcoin’s base layer.

* Alternative **consensus mechanisms** to replace Nakamoto Consensus, such as
Proof-of-Stake
[(Tendermint](https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#what-is-tendermint),
Ethereum’s [Casper,](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf) DFINITY’s [Threshold

AI governance, or Bitcoin Unlimited’s [miners
voting](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/solutions/miners).

Bitcoiners generally take
[issue](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf) with Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) where validators propose and vote on blocks instead of solving
energy-intensive cryptographic puzzles. They believe Bitcoin software should be
handled with the [same respect as nuclear reactor
software](https://medium.com/@hugonguyen/proof-of-stake-the-wrong-engineering-mindset-15e641ab65a2),
and discount PoS due to its “subjective” nature, which means participation in
the network requires subjective information like social information. This
contrasts to PoW objectivity where nodes necessarily arrive at the current state
by observing the heaviest PoW chain.

Many view PoS as a digital version of the fiat-money system, with PoS validation
being anti-competitive in comparison to mining and lacking any ties to
real-world value (energy).

Meanwhile, PoS advocates have “[learned to love” weak
subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/)
and aim to simulate the security of PoW through threats of economic penalties
for validators (slashing dishonest actors by taking away deposits) instead of
burning physical energy. They deem PoW as energy wasteful, and think it’s
possible to design a PoS protocol that is more secure, decentralized, offers
faster block times, and is more flexible than PoW, which is “limited” by
physics.

In distributed systems terms, Nakamoto Consensus favors liveness (availability)
over safety (consistency) and achieves probabilistic finality of transactions
that increases with the number of new blocks.

Currently, with Casper’s PoS, for example, economic finality is to be achieved
once validators fully commit to a block and comes at the cost of some
availability. Because finality requires some upper-bound synchrony[
assumption](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-3-70fefb1182fc),
extraordinary events could theoretically partition a significant portion of the
network or shut down the entire network for a greater amount of time than this
upper-bound validator response time.

This could cause either some partitions to lack the majority of votes needed to
come to consensus or the lack of ability for the network to choose a canonical
chain when the partition or shut down ends. This could end with liveness or
safety faults requiring human action, whereas with PoW, network partitions
create temporary forks, which are necessarily resolved through the heaviest
chain once the partition is resolved.

There is overwhelming consensus that there should be no experimentation and as
little changes made as possible to the base BTC layer, and that payment channels
and sidechains should not weaken the security of the base layer. Some users are
enthusiastic about the potential of upper-layer systems to bootstrap further
utility on Bitcoin.

The main philosophy is to have a hyper-decentralized, hyper-secure base layer
that is used to bootstrap security for slightly more insecure protocols on top
layers.

**Lightning Network**

Proponents of the Lightning Network consider it to be the most feasible solution
to the current Bitcoin scalability problem, allowing people to transact nearly
without limits using peer-to-peer payment channels and smart contracts, while
using the *main* Bitcoin chain for occasional settlement purposes.

Despite only being conceptualized three years ago, and only being in beta for
several months, the Lightning Network is already seeing a wave of innovations,
such as [Dual-Funded
Channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184),
[Submarine Swaps](https://submarineswaps.org/), Channel Splicing and Factories,
Watchtowers,
[Eltoo](https://blockstream.com/2018/04/30/eltoo-next-lightning.html), Atomic
Swaps, and more all covered
[here](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/future-bitcoin-what-lightning-could-look/).

One common concern about second-layer solutions is that they will negatively
impact miners revenue by taking more transactions off-chain. Initial
[research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.10222.pdf),
[presented](https://scalingbitcoin.org/stanford2017/Day2/HowToChargeLightning_ScalingBitcoin.pdf)
at Scaling Bitcoin 2017, estimated that miner revenue could increase after 20
million users were using the Lightning Network, although decrease under that
threshold.

It is important to note that Lightning Network is an extremely new, unproven and
immature system. However, many developers believe that it will greatly improve
the scalability of Bitcoin and enable cheap micro-transactions, paving a way for
Bitcoin to potentially be used as an effective medium of exchange and true
global currency.

At the very least, Lightning Network occupies a niche, which will be valuable in
itself. And at the most, we haven’t even scratched the surface of the upside,
potential, and capabilities enabled by the Lightning Network, such as
third-layer projects.

### Conclusion

Bitcoin is the original, longest-lasting cryptocurrency with the highest levels
of hashpower, network effects, liquidity, market capitalization, and arguably
the highest amount of “HODLers of last resort.” This article attempted to
outline the so-called ‘small blocker’ and ‘big blocker’ positions on the most
notable changes, milestones and debates throughout Bitcoin’s past and its
near-term future.

The open-source, global and decentralized nature of these digital money-forms
makes the governance of these systems complex and even minor changes contentious
and controversial. Almost 10 years into its history, Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies as an asset class are beginning to challenge monetary metals as
the defacto store of value assets of the future, as well as challenge existing
global payment rails and mechanisms. We believe that the future is bright for
Bitcoin and its spiritual brethren.
