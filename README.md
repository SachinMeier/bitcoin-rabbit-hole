## Suggesting Content

All resources have a corresponding markdown file found under `collections`. To suggest a new resource, create a new `.md` file and submit a pull request. [Here](https://github.com/adamtache/bitcoin-rabbit-hole/pull/1/files) is a sample pull request, including submitting a new author.

## Cloning BRH

If you would like to fork BRH and create your own resources site, there is a useful [script](https://github.com/adamtache/bitcoin-rabbit-hole/tree/master/scripts/spreadsheet_to_resource_mds) for generating large amounts of resource markdown files at once by parsing information entered into a Google Spreadsheet. You will want to modify the script for your spreadsheet's parameters.
